          <h5 id="estimates">Estimates</h5>
          <p>
            RTR Technologies may provide Clients with initial estimates,
            otherwise referred to as quotations, for projects on request. The
            final project value may vary from the initial quotation if additions
            are requested to the original scope of work.
            <br /><br />
            RTR Technologies will provide quotations in writing by email to
            Clients, which will include a hyperlink to these Terms and
            Conditions. Acceptance by a Client of a RTR Technologies estimate is
            subject to acceptance of the terms and conditions unless
            specifically agreed in writing between the Client and RTR
            Technologies to the contrary.
          </p>
          <h5 id="invoicing-and-payment-terms">Invoicing & Payment Terms</h5>
          <p>
            RTR Technologies standard payment terms are 7 days from the date of
            invoice.
            <br /><br />
            New projects require a 50% upfront payment for the commencement of a
            project, 40% once the development is complete and a final payment
            before the project is made live.
            <br /><br />
            Monthly or retainer invoices will be invoiced by the 2nd of the
            month and needs to be paid within seven business days thereafter.
            Late payment will result in interest being charged to the account
            and a suspension of retainer services.
            <br /><br />
            In the event that website development cost has been broken up into a
            payment plan, RTR Technologies will remain the owners of the website
            until the design and development work has been paid in full as per
            the initial quotation.
          </p>
          <h5 id="project-terms">Project Terms</h5>
          <p>
            Unless expressly agreed in writing to the contrary RTR Technologies
            will not accept liability to the Client for unforeseen delays in
            completing a project.
            <br /><br />
            In the event that there is a delay in the completion of a project,
            RTR Technologies will communicate such delays to the Client in
            writing via email.
            <br /><br />
            All website or online marketing tactic setup content needs to be
            provided by the client within 2 weeks of a deposit being paid to
            commence a project.
            <br /><br />
            All Graphic design content needs to be provided within 1 week of a
            deposit being paid to commence a project.
            <br /><br />
            The client is required to provide RTR Technologies with all the
            content required for a project within the period detailed above.
            Should the client delay issuing RTR Technologies with the content
            required for the project, RTR Technologies reserves the right to
            renegotiate the cost of the project as well as the expected
            completion date. In such instances, RTR Technologies will request
            any outstanding payments to be settled before the continuation of
            the project.
          </p>
          <h5 id="ongoing-maintanence-and-support">
            Ongoing Maintanence & Support
          </h5>
          <p>
            Fixes for newly built websites need to be identified within a 14 day
            period from going live. If fixes are identified after this period
            and the client is not on a Maintenance agreement then a quotation
            will be issued to commence such fixes.
            <br /><br />
            RTR Technologies cannot future proof its services or products. Once
            a client has signed off on a project the responsibility to maintain
            and update plugins and Themes used on the website becomes the
            client’s responsibility unless a maintenance agreement has been
            signed with RTR Technologies which covers such incidents.
            <br /><br />
            Maintenance does not mean “eyes on the website” all the time and
            issues on the website still need to be reported to RTR
            Technologies’s account manager.
            <br /><br />
            Development faults with plugins or themes used on a website built by
            RTR Technologies are not covered by a maintenance agreement and will
            be quoted for separately as in most cases the original software
            developer will need to be involved.
            <br /><br />
            Similarly, hosting and website faults remain the responsibility of
            the hosting provider and do not fall under any maintenance
            agreement.
            <br /><br />
            A RTR Technologies account manager can be present to consult at
            external meetings if required, however, such meetings need to be
            arranged in advance and unless prior arrangements have been made
            such consultations will be limited to one meeting per month of a
            maximum duration of 1 hour. Consultations will be charged at our
            standard consulting rate.
          </p>
          <h5 id="termination-of-service">Termination of Service</h5>
          <p>
            Cancellation of any products or services may be made at any time by
            providing RTR Technologies with a cancellation request 1 calendar
            month in advance, in writing.
            <br /><br />
            In the event of cancellation of the agreement prior to the
            completion of the cancellation period, RTR Technologies reserves the
            right to pursue any of the following: <br />
            (1) remove equipment, software, services or resources owned by the
            Company, <br />(2) bring legal action against the Client for
            contractual breach or <br />(3) remove any created websites,
            graphics, content, links, advertising and accounts.
          </p>
          <h5 id="third-party-services">3rd Party Services</h5>
          <p>
            RTR Technologies will offer to Clients’ third-party services such as
            those offered by Google to enhance the performance of their
            websites. RTR Technologies may include in quotations the setup and
            maintenance of such third-party services. RTR Technologies will not
            be liable to the Client for any interruption, non-performance, or
            cancellation of the provision by third parties of any such services.
          </p>
          <h5 id="website-development-and-design-terms-and-conditions">
            Website Development & Design Terms and Conditions
          </h5>
          <p>
            All website content needs to be provided by the client within 2
            weeks of payment of a deposit to commence a project. Should the
            client delay issuing RTR Technologies the content required for the
            project, RTR Technologies reserves the right to renegotiate the cost
            of the project as well as the expected completion date. In such
            instances, RTR Technologies will request any outstanding payments to
            be settled before the continuation of the project.
            <br /><br />
            CMS websites require updates to plugins and themes. If the client
            has not opted for monthly maintenance, such updates and the cost
            thereof, remain the responsibility of the client. However, plugins

            third-party search engines, directories or other websites
            (“Third-Party Resources”) that the Client may submit to with respect

            in the future. The Client’s web site or content may be excluded or

            agrees not to hold Web Agency Network responsible for any liability
            or actions taken by Third-Party Resources under this Agreement.
            <br /><br />
            The Client furthermore acknowledges that the nature of many of the
            resources the RTR Technologies may employ under this Agreement are
            competitive, therefore RTR Technologies does not guarantee top
            rankings, consistent positioning or specific performance of any
            strategies employed and the Client accepts that the RTR Technologies
            past performance is not indicative of any future results the Client
            may experience.
            <br /><br />
            The Client recognizes that SEO and submissions to search engines and
            directories can take an indefinite amount of time for acceptance or
            inclusion and that internet advertising may be subject to the
            individual advertising network’s policies and procedures.
            <br /><br />
            The Client accepts that Google Adwords, search engines, directories
            or other resources may block, prevent or otherwise stop accepting
            submissions for an indefinite period of time.
            <br /><br />
            The Client acknowledges that search engines may drop listings from
            its database for no apparent or predictable reason. The Company
            shall re-submit resources to the search engine based on the current
            policies of the search engine in question.

            Technologies may not become aware of changes to third-party
            resources, industry changes or any other changes that may or may not
            affect campaigns or services.
            <br /><br />
            RTR Technologies, for the duration of this agreement, may develop
            design strategies and codes, which, in RTR Technologies’s opinion
            improve the Client’s website. RTR Technologies and the Client will
            review these suggestions together and once mutual agreement is
            reached activate these changes. If the Client decides to make any
            material changes to the website, the Client will consult with RTR
            Technologies prior to implementing these changes, to make sure that
            they do not conflict with RTR Technologies marketing strategy.
            <br /><br />

            and can very often affect any business page installations and
            applications. The Company will not be held liable for these changes
            and, should work need to be done to rectify, then a new “quote”
            would need to be drawn up.

            policy to make them continue to work with us. We are not concerned
            about the money we do not deserve.

                  The length of time it takes to create a fully functional
                  website is based on several factors. <br />Custom design work
                  can take anywhere from 1 – 4 weeks, depending on the
                  complexity of the design and the number of revisions you
                  require. <br />The development phase requires an additional 1
                  – 6 weeks, depending on the number of pages, and the
                  functionality required. <br />Of course, these are general
                  guidelines, and we will make every effort to meet the
                  timeframe you have in mind.

                  HTTP, aka HyperText Transfer Protocol, is the underlying

                  CORS, aka Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a mechanism that
                  enables many resources (e.g. images, stylesheets, scripts,
                  fonts) on a web page to be requested from another domain
                  outside the domain from which the resource originated.
